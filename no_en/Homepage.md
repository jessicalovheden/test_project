# Homepage

The VOM homepage presents the user at the top of the screen with an overview of all the tabs where it is possible to navigate to. The user has access to different tabs, depending on what VOM role is assigned to the account (e.g. User / Team Manager / HR, etc). Please refer to the "VOM Roles" section above for a more full overview of the functionalities available for each role.

On the homepage, all VOM users have access to the Search function as well as the Announcements section at the bottom.

**Search**

The search function allows everyone to search by name, username or email, any Visma employee or external consultant which is registered in VOM.

The result shows more information about the employee and the connected teams, organization and manager.
