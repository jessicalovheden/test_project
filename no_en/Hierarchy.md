# Hierarchy

## Navigations through the Visma Hierarchy

The Hierarchy tab shows the entire Visma Organizational structure and shows under which division and organization a company falls. You can navigate from Top to bottom through the interactive structure and go through any of the following units.

-   Division
-   Business Area (if any)
-   Organisation
-   Team
-   Further Sub-Teams (if any)

On the top left corner, the table view allows for a quick navigation between the different Organizational Units in a table format and to subsequently focus visualization on a specific node (e.g. a Business Area/Organisation, etc) and the direct units under the selection.
