# VOM Roles (Authorization)

Any Visma employee can access VOM, however, there are certain roles intended for administrative purposes and these are further detailed in the section below.

VOM Role

Overview and description of role

How to obtain the role?

**User**

Role assigned by default to all employees added in VOM. It allows for logging in VOM and grants access to the common features like Home page, Statistics, Hierarchy, and Location directory.

Role allows also for changes of certain information on own profile  **only**.  (example: Mobile, Address).

By default  **all Visma employees**, will have the "User" role assigned when created in VOM.

**Team Manager**

Role assigned by default to all employees which are added as responsible to team structures.

It allows the team managers to see certain information about the employees they manage but also to make few changes on these. (example: Mobile, Address, QMS roles) from within the team he/she is responsible for.

Role & permissions to teams and sub-teams  **given automatically**  when an employee is set as responsible on a team in the Hierarchy section

**Business Controller**

Role which can be assigned for Visma employees which need to use employee related information for different business related processes (e.g. reporting, invoicing, headcount reports, etc).

Role is not able to edit employees in VOM and access to sensitive fields is restricted.

Via request to Visma People's Team at  [people@visma.com](mailto:people@visma.com)

**Now: the role should be assigned manually with a scope defined, except Group HR.**

**Payroll Consultant**

Role which can be assigned for Visma employees or external contractors which need to use employee related information for different business related processes where sensitive information is required (e.g. payroll).

Role is not able to edit employees in VOM.

**HR**

HR role used for maintaining Team structures as well as the employees from within assigned organisations.

**Group HR**

HR role with more actions available than the general HR role, which helps to maintain the higher structure of the Visma Hierarchy (e.g. Business Areas / Divisions / Organisations / Offices, etc) in addition to managing employees.

**Support (IT Support/Delivery HUB)**

User role which only employees from VIT supporting teams have. Used by the VOM Support team to assist all Visma VOM users but also to help maintain items that affect other systems from within VOM (e.g. creation / editing of Legal Units which affect the Identity & Access Management Structures).

  

  

Intended only for Visma IT

**Developer (People HUB)**

User role which only employees from VIT VOM development team have. It facilitates also creation of other user roles and general configuration for the VOM Modules.

  

The completed access in VOM (or the Authorization) consists of 2 components,  **roles** &  **scope** assigned.

**Functionality** in VOM is segregated per the above mentioned roles and certain features are available only to some roles (e.g. Subscriptions are not available for users with "Team Manager" role or deleting Legal Units is not available to HR roles). For a full overview of the accesses of each role, please refer to the  [following document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WWQ1_gf11BJzM3SWXoW2s0GyBs2MI96qWOeWyFn_dxY/edit#gid=64457408).

**Scopes**  on the other hand indicate the subset of **employee data**  that a VOM user should have access to with the assigned role. Scopes can be either Legal Units, Divisions, Organizations or Teams, depending on what the user needs access to. Additionally, combinations of Legal units and specific Hierarchy structures can be added for a more granular access (e.g. to see employees in the Visma IT Organisation BUT only from the Visma Software SRL legal unit)
